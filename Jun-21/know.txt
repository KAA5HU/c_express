There are two ways to connect to Oracle Database using cx_Oracle:

-> Standalone connections

These are useful when the application maintains a single user session to a database. Connections are created by cx_Oracle.connect() or its alias cx_Oracle.Connection().

-> Pooled connections

Connection pooling is important for performance when applications frequently connect and disconnect from the database. Pools support Oracle’s high availability features and are recommended for applications that must be reliable
Pools are created with cx_Oracle.SessionPool()

cx_oracle:
	cx_Oracle is a module that enables access to Oracle Database and conforms to the Python database API specification

cursor:
	The MySQLCursor of mysql-connector-python (and similar libraries) is used to execute statements to communicate with the MySQL database.

Queries (statements beginning with SELECT or WITH) can only be executed using the method Cursor.execute()

commit: 
	The commit () method is used to make sure the changes made to the database are consistent

scrollable is used to get particular row or data

queries: select like_table.tweet_id, count(*) as no_of_likes from like_table inner join tweet_table on like_table.tweet_id = tweet_table.tweet_id
group by like_table.tweet_id

select name from user_table inner join follower_table on user_table.user_id = follower_table.follower_user_id
where following_user_id = 1
order by name desc

select user_id, count(*) as no_of_followers from user_table inner join follower_table on user_table.user_id = follower_table.follower_user_id
group by follower_user_id
having follower_user_id = 1


select reply_table.user_id, tweet_table.tweet, reply_table.reply as reply_to_msg, reply_table.date_time from tweet_table inner join reply_table on tweet_table.tweet_id = reply_table.tweet_id inner join user_table on user_table.user_id = reply_table.user_id
where tweet_table.user_id = 1

Document object model(DOM) : When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
it has tree like strucucture.
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element

Document object: is nothing but a web page
we can access and manupilate any element in the html page

document.getElementById(id)
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
document.getElementsByClassName(name)

The Doctype is not an element or tag, it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML
document type definition (DTD) 
InnerHTML property is used for modifying the HTML content from JavaScript code. InnerHTML property is also used for writing dynamic html content on html documents

http protocol: HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources
import: Used to read code exported from another module
export: Used to provide code to other modules
modules

modules: independent units reuseable codes

require: require function is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files

yield: Pause and resume a generator function.

async function: The async function defines an async function expression.
await: Pause and resume an async function and wait for the promise's resolution/rejection.

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing. XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.
This interface also inherits properties of XMLHttpRequestEventTarget and of EventTarget.

Firefox Developer Tools is a set of web developer tools built into Firefox. You can use them to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTTP protocol: 
	Application Layer, transmitting documents like HTML
	used to communicate web browser and web server
	client and server model
	stateless protocol(meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests It does not require the server to retain session information)
	tcp/ip realible

HTTP cache : cache is used for fast web site. it reduces the latancy and network traffic and becomes more responsive

cookies: small pieces of data
	server sends to the web browser
	browser  stores and send back for later reqeuest
	typically when wo request came from same browsers
IP address: An IP address is a number assigned to every device connected to a network that uses the Internet protocol. 

PORT: port is communication end point
	 HTTP protocol is 80
	 HTTPS protocol is 443
	server waits for request on this ports
	port: SMTP (25), POP3 (110), IMAP (143), IRC (194)(default ports)

HTTPs : it is encrypted version of http. it uses ssl(secure socket layes is security network which encript data) and tcl(transport layer security) to encrypt all communication between client and server
	This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server

ES6
Arrows: These are a function which is described by the ‘=>’ syntax
Objects: Object literals are used to support prototype assignments.
Classes: ES6 classes can be easily implemented over the prototype-based object-oriented pattern
Destructing: It allows binding pattern, which is based primarily on pattern matching.
String interpolation(placeholders)
Default(no other values are provided)
Spread(copy of objects or update values)
Module Loaders

New Library
Promises
Proxies

Promises:
	The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
	PENDING, FULFILLED, REJECTED
	 Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promise.
.then() : method takes two arguments
	1) the first argument is a callback function for the resolved case of the promise
	2) the second argument is a callback function for the rejected case

local storage: 
	The localStorage object provides access to a local storage for a particular Web Site. It allows you to store, read, add, modify, and delete data items for that domain.
methods like setItem, getItem, removeItem etc.

what is internet?
the internet is a global collection of networks of computers connected to each other. These networks allow data to be transferred between the computers/devices connected to them. "This exchange of data is possible only because all the computers on the network play by the same set of rules, called the Internet Protocol (IP)"

we do not access internet directly we request to the server of teh website via of ISPs. And results are come from ISPs.

when we want to send the data to the another device(sender->isp->(the data is split into many packets that travel multiple network paths and the packets are arranged in the original order)Routers->isp->recipient)

isp: internet service providers: serveice for accessing, using or participating inthe internet
application layer, transport layer, network layer, physical layer
what is tcp/ip: Transition control protocol/internet protocol this are in network layer
Mainly used for communication protocols
tcp and ip protocol that makes internet possible

tcp defines how applications create communication channels, also managed how a message is broken down to be transmmited and reassemble

ip defines how to address and route packets for delivery.(ensures the path) 

ipv4: it is used to identify the devices, 32bit, numeric ip address
features:
	Connectionless Protocol(a message is sent from one end point to another without a prior arrangement.)
	Allow creating a simple virtual communication layer over diversified devices
	It requires less memory, and ease of remembering addresses
	Already supported protocol by millions of devices
	Offers video libraries and conferences
ipv6: latest version, 128bit, also called ipng(internet protocol next generation), alpha numeric
features:
	Hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure
	Stateful and Stateless configuration
	Support for quality of service (QoS)
	An ideal protocol for neighboring node interaction

DNS: Domain name servers
DNS eliminates to memorize the ip address
users connect websites through domain names instead of ip addresss
DNS translate domain name to ip address to understand broswer

PORT: 16 bit unsigned integer
tcp port number is 0 is resereved

middleware function: Middleware appears in the middle between an initial request and final intended route.
this middle ware functions are invoked in an order.
define: Middleware functions are the functions that access to the request and response object (req, res) in request-response cycle.

It can execute any code.
It can make changes to the request and the response objects.
It can end the request-response cycle.
It can call the next middleware function in the stack.
